# Schoolhouse.world Machine Learning Course

These files contain course projects that I have designed for a Schoolhouse.world course that I am teaching for free (not getting paid in money or volunteer hours). Each file contains instructions on how to use each block of jupyter notebook code.

You can run the code by downloading the dataset `.csv` file and the Jupyter notebook file. Open the .ipyb file and click run using VS Code. It will ask you to enter your house details. Once you do that, it will output the predicted price of your house using regression.
